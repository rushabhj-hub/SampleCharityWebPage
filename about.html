            <h3>About us</h3>
            Since 2001, we've been empowering millions of donors by providing them with free access to data, tools, and
            resources to guide philanthropic decision-making. Through our ratings, nonprofits are equipped with the
            nonprofit sector's premier trust indicator and a powerful platform to raise awareness and funds.

            Accessed more than 11 million times annually, donors can give with confidence knowing the organizations that
            are highly rated on Charity Navigator efficiently steward donations and are accountable and transparent.
            While we have a large footprint and an established, trusted brand, our team of approximately 25 considers
            itself small-but-mighty.

            Like the nonprofits we rate, we're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, too. We don't charge the organizations we
            evaluate, ensuring our ratings remain objective. In turn, we depend on the generosity of individuals,
            foundations, and corporations to fund our programs.
